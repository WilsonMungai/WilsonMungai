Hi, I'm Wilson. I truly enjoy creating applications because they allow me to realize my ideas. I've been investing at least 5 hours every day in honing my iOS coding abilities. I also use Dart and flutter to create cross-platform applications. Also, I have a strong enthusiasm for user interface since I want the people who will use my projects to enjoy and value my efforts.

Skills: Swift / SwiftUI / Flutter / Dart
